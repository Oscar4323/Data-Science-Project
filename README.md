**Project Title:** Crime Rates in The Bronx
This project is going to be based around crimes in the Bronx. Crime rates, and finding the safest and most dangerous neighborhoods, using data from NYC open data. It will be using many data visualization methods, such as bar graphs, time series graphs.

**Datasets:**
This project uses data from NYC OpenData, to gather criminal offense information from the years 2019-2021.

NYC Hate Crime,
NYC Arrest Data Historic
1) The NYC Hate Crime Dataset contains infromation on reported/valid HateCrime offenses in the Bronx. Ranging from misdemeanors to Felony offenses, driven by hateful motives such as: Homophobia, Religion, Race, etc.

2) NYC Arrest Data Historic Dataset contains every arrest in NYC (we will be working with years from 2020-2021). This dataset includes much harsher crimes, and offenders' demographics such as sex and age.

**Techniques:**
To explore and clean my datasets, I utilized the Pandas package. This allowed me to drop, concatenate, and cut the datasets down to only the Bronx. Using matplotlib, seaborn, etc. I was able to create graphical visualizations such as: bar graphs, horizontal bar graphs, pie charts, line graphs, and tree-maps to make it user-viewer friendly, and easy to read the findings.
